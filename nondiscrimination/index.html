<h2 id="adopted-by-the-board-of-directors-on-thursday-june-18-2015">Adopted by the Board of Directors on Thursday, June 18, 2015</h2>

<p>Internet Security Research Group does not and shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color,
religion (creed), gender, gender expression, age, national origin (ancestry), disability, marital
status, sexual orientation, or military status, or any other protected classification under federal,
state or local law, in any of its activities or operations. These activities include, but are not
limited to, hiring and firing of staff, selection of volunteers and vendors, and provision of
services. We are committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming environment for all
members of our staff, clients, volunteers, subcontractors, vendors, and clients.</p>

<p>Internet Security Research Group is an equal opportunity employer. We will not discriminate and
will take affirmative action measures to ensure against discrimination in employment,
recruitment, advertisements for employment, compensation, termination, upgrading, promotions,
and other conditions of employment against any employee or job applicant on the bases of race,
color, gender, national origin, age, religion, creed, disability, veteran’s status, sexual orientation,
gender identity or gender expression, or any other protected classification under federal, state or
local law.</p>

<h2 id="anti-harassment-policy">Anti-Harassment Policy</h2>

<p>We are committed in all areas to providing a work environment that is free from harassment.
Harassment based upon an individual’s sex, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, national origin,
age, religion or any other legally protected characteristics will not be tolerated. All employees,
including supervisors and other management personnel, are expected and required to abide by
this policy. No person will be adversely affected in employment with our organization as a result
of bringing complaints of unlawful harassment.</p>

<p>Sexual harassment is behavior of a sexual nature that is unwelcome and offensive to the person
or persons it is targeted toward. Examples of harassing behavior may include unwanted physical
contact, foul language of an offensive sexual nature, sexual propositions, sexual jokes or
remarks, obscene gestures, and displays of pornographic or sexually explicit pictures, drawings,
or caricatures. Use of our computer system for the purpose of viewing, displaying, or
disseminating material that is sexual in nature may also constitute harassing behavior.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-harassment">Reporting Harassment</h2>

<p>If an employee feels that he or she has been harassed on the basis of his or her sex, sexual
orientation, race, national origin, ethnic background, or any other legally protected characteristic
they should immediately report the matter to his or her supervisor, and where appropriate,
provide written statements regarding the nature of such harassment. If the employee’s supervisor
is not available, or if the employee feels it would be unproductive to inform the supervisor, the
employee should immediately contact that supervisor’s superior or human resources. Once the
matter has been reported it will be promptly and fairly investigated and any necessary corrective
action will be taken where appropriate. All complaints of unlawful harassment will be handled in
as discreet and confidential a manner as is possible under the circumstances. The procedure for
reporting incidents of harassing behavior is not intended to impair, replace, or limit the right of
any employee to seek a remedy under available state or federal law by immediately reporting the
matter to the appropriate state or federal agency.</p>

<h2 id="disciplinary-measures-for-harassment">Disciplinary Measures for Harassment</h2>

<p>Any employee engaging in improper harassing behavior will be subject to disciplinary action,
including the possible immediate termination of employment. Not every instance of harassing
behavior will warrant immediate termination, but some may.</p>
